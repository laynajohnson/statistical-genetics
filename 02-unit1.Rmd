# Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)


## Some Vocabulary

There are many terms that come along with talking about genetic data. The following are terms to remember as you read this unit summary. Refer to this list if you forget what a term means.

-   [*SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms)*]{.underline}: a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome

    -   [*Genome*]{.underline}: complete set of genes or genetic material

    -   [*Chromosome*]{.underline}: condensed DNA structure, all chromosomes together is the genome

-   [*Genetic variants*]{.underline}: positions where DNA sequences differ

    -   [*SNV (single nucleotide variant)*]{.underline}: a single nucleotide change in the DNA sequence. *SNP* and *SNV* are typically used interchangeably. You might see *SNP* used in instances where the minor allele is not too rare

-   [*Allele*]{.underline}: the different possible nucleotides at some position. The combinations are *A* with *T* and *G* with *C*

-   [*Minor allele*]{.underline}: at this location, which allele is the least common

    -   [*MAF (minor allele frequency)*]{.underline}: the frequency of the minor allele, can get very small

-   [*Loci/locus*]{.underline}: means location, can be used to refer to a single *SNP* or a larger region in the genome


## Introduction to GWAS

  When looking at human DNA, we can see that between any two people, their genomes would be almost exactly identical. However, there are places where their DNA sequences differ. These are called *genetic variants*. Sometimes these variants mean nothing, other times they have been found to be linked to certain traits or health problems. The goal of a genome-wide association study (GWAS), is to determine which genetic variants are associated with a given trait of interest.
