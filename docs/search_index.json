The following are terms to remember as you read this unit summary. Refer to this list if you forget what a term means. SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms): a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome Genome: complete set of genes or genetic material Chromosome: condensed DNA structure, all chromosomes together is the genome Genetic variants: positions where DNA sequences differ SNV (single nucleotide variant): a single nucleotide change in the DNA sequence. SNP and SNV are typically used interchangeably. You might see SNP used in instances where the minor allele is not too rare Allele: the different possible nucleotides at some position. The combinations are A with T and G with C Minor allele: at this location, which allele is the least common MAF (minor allele frequency): the frequency of the minor allele, can get very small Loci/locus: means location, can be used to refer to a single SNP or a larger region in the genome "],["genetic-ancestry.html", " 3 Genetic Ancestry", " 3 Genetic Ancestry "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
